# `comments`

`comments` is a very simple, self hosteable, comments service for your web. It uses [htmx][htmx] so it's great if you're already using it. Can be as simple as:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.12"></script>
<div hx-get="https://example.com/comments" hx-trigger="load"></div>
```

[htmx]: https://htmx.org
